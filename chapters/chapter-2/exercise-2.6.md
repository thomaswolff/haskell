# Exercise 2.6

1. 
  a. `8+7*9`
  b. `(8+7)*9`

Answer: The results are different, because multiplication has higher precedence than addition. In a), `7*9` is evaluated first, before it's result is added to `8`. In b) however, `8+7` is evaluated first, and then multiplied by `9`.

2. 
  a. `perimiter x y = (x*2) + (y*2)`
  b. `perimiter x y = x*2 + y*2`

Answer: The results are the same, because the parentheses doesn't change the order in which the expression is evaluated.

3. 
  a. `f x = x / 2 + 9`
  b. `f x = x / (2 + 9)`

Answer: The results are different, because division has higher precedence than addition. The parentheses in b) changes the order in which the expression is evaluated, and thus changes the value it evaluates to.
